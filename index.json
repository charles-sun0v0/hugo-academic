Output as a way to learn. Inspired by Feynman techniques, I might try to explain complex concepts or knowledge in simple words if I need to understand something deeply. As a programmer, I have to continuous learning, which is also I would love to do. But I also care about how to learn fast and efficiently. I think some key concepts and core knowledge matters most in programming, and writing is a good technique to understand the knowledge better and deeper.\nDisplay work and portfolio. During the job hunt process, I realize that the best CV is a portfolio. It might take time to accumulate a persuasive portfolio. What I enjoy most is the inner reward of making something (either writing an article or writing code).\nPractice English writing skills. I recently relocated to the UK, a new challenge in my career and life, therefore it is important for me a non-native speaker practice English. And writing is an efficient way of practice. I have a Chinese blog https://01io.tech running for about 2 years and now I start this English (maybe bilingual later) site try to post my writing\nTools I used to set up a dynamic personal website with WordPress and ran for more than 2 years. But I find a static website might is much easier to maintain and let me focus on writing.\nAfter some research, I decide to use Hugo to generate the sites from markdown and host on github.io.\n","date":1678580987,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678580987,"objectID":"bd6b3508832ea80d0f278feb05a867c9","permalink":"https://charles-sun0v0.github.io/post/preface/","publishdate":"2023-03-12T00:29:47Z","relpermalink":"/post/preface/","section":"post","summary":"1. output as a way to learn. 2.
