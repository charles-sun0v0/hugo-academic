As the first post of my new sites, it deserves to tell something about my motives for writing.

## Why do I write?

1. **Output as a way to learn**. Inspired by Feynman techniques, I might try to explain complex concepts or knowledge in simple words if I need to understand something deeply. As a programmer, I have to continuous learning, which is also I would love to do. But I also care about how to learn fast and efficiently. I think some key concepts and core knowledge matters most in programming, and writing is a good technique to understand the knowledge better and deeper.
  
2. **Display work and portfolio**. During the job hunt process, I realize that the best CV is a portfolio. It might take time to accumulate a persuasive portfolio. What I enjoy most is the inner reward of making something (either writing an article or writing code).

3. **Practice English writing skills**. I recently relocated to the UK, a new challenge in my career and life, therefore it is important for me a non-native speaker practice English. And writing is an efficient way of practice. I have a Chinese blog <https://01io.tech> running for about 2 years and now I start this English (maybe bilingual later) site try to post my writing

## Tools

I used to set up a dynamic personal website with WordPress and ran for more than 2 years. But I find a static website might is much easier to maintain and let me focus on writing.

After some research, I decide to use Hugo to generate the sites from markdown and host on github.io.
